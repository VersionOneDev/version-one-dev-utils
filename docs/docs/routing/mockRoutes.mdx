# Mocking Routes with Storybook

A MockRoute component is available for use with Storybook to help development of components that rely on routing.

## Setup

To begin routes should be configured in Storybook by adding the `RouteProvider` and `MockRoute` component to a decorator in `.storybook/preview.js`

```jsx
import { addDecorator } from "@storybook/react";

import { RouteProvider } from "version-one-dev-utils";
import { MockRouter } from "version-one-dev-utils/storybook";

import { routes } from "../src/routes";

addDecorator((storyFn) => {
  return (
    <RouteProvider value={routes}>
      <MockRouter>{storyFn()}</MockRouter>
    </RouteProvider>
  );
});
```

## Setting the route

Routes can be set on a per story basis by wrapping a component in `<MockRoute/>`.

`MockRoute` accepts two props: a url (the path with params, query, and hash values), and a route to test against.
These mock values will be used to populate the router state returned by the `useRoutes` hook.

`MyComponent.stories.js`

```jsx
import { MockRouter } from "version-one-dev-utils/storybook";

export const Default = (args) => {
  const { props } = args;
  return (
    <MockRouter route="/item/:id" url="/item/one">
      <MyComponent {...props} />
    </MockRouter>
  );
};

Default.args = {
  props: {},
};
```

`MyComponent.js`

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { useRoutes } from "version-one-dev-utils";

export function MyComponent() {
  const { params } = useRoutes();

  return (
    {/* params.id will be 'one' */}
    <p>My id is: {{ params.id }}</p>

  );
}
```
