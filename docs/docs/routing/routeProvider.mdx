# Configuring routes with the RouterProvider

The `RouteProvider` should be used once in the base component of your app.
Configuring the routes this way provides the app's container components an easy way to access and move between routes later on via the `useRoutes` hook.

```jsx
import React from "react";
// Import React Router components to do the routing
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from "react-router-dom";
// Import the RouteProvider to config the useRoutes hook
import { RouteProvider } from "version-one-dev-utils";

const routes = {
  HOME: "/",
  PAGE_ONE: "/one",
  PAGE_TWO: "/two",
  NOT_FOUND: "*",
};

export function App() {
  return (
    <RouteProvider value={routes}>
      <Router>
        <Route path={routes.HOME} exact>
          <Home />
        </Route>
        <Route path={routes.PAGE_ONE} exact>
          <PageOne />
        </Route>
        <Route path={routes.PAGE_TWO} exact>
          <PageTwo />
        </Route>
        <Route path={routes.NOT_FOUND}>
          <p>404 Not Found</p>
        </Route>
      </Router>
    </RouteProvider>
  );
}
```
