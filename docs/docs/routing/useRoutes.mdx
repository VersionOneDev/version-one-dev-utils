# The useRoutes Hook

The `useRoutes` hook is the easiest way access and move between routes.

When called it will return an object with the following properties:

| Property | Value                                                                     |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| routes   | The routes config object passed to the `RouteProvider`.                   |
| route    | The value of the nearest parent route.                                    |
| params   | The params of the nearest parent route.                                   |
| path     | The path of the current router location.                                  |
| hash     | The hash (#) value.                                                       |
| query    | An object of key/value pairs generated from the query string.             |
| link     | A function that returns a path to link to another route.                  |
| push     | A function that can be used to move to another route.                     |
| replace  | A function that can be used to replace the current route.                 |
| match    | A function that can be used to check if a route matches the current path. |

## Navigating between routes

The `useRoutes` hook offers three ways to navigate to another route with the `link` `push`, and `replace`, functions.
Each function accepts a `route`, and optional `params` and `query` objects.

### Link

The link function will return a path that can be used when creating links in an app:

```jsx
const { link, routes } = useRoutes();

return <Link to={link(routes.PAGE_TWO)}>Go to page Two</Link>;
```

:::note
Where possible **links should be the primary way of navigating around an app.**
They are the standard way of navigating pages in a web browser and provide the user with greater feedback than a button with an onClick handler.
:::

### Push

When linking to a route is not possible the push function can be used instead.
This will move to the new route and add it to the routing history so it will remain accessible via the forward and back buttons when viewed in a web browser.

```jsx
const { push, routes } = useRoutes();

return (
  <button
    onClick={() => push(routes.PAGE_TWO, /* Optional state object */ state)}
  >
    Go to page Two
  </button>
);
```

### Replace

Sometimes it may be preferable to replace a route rather than move to it.
The replace function will switch to the new route and replace the current route in the routing history so it is no longer accessible via the forward and back buttons when viewed in a web browser.

```jsx
const { replace, routes } = useRoutes();

return (
  <button
    onClick={() => replace(routes.PAGE_TWO, /* Optional state object */ state)}
  >
    Go to page Two
  </button>
);
```

## Accessing the current state of the router

The `route`, `params`, `path`, `hash`, and `query` properties make up the current state of the router.

Whilst `path`, `hash`, and `query` are consistent across all instances of the `useRoutes` hook, `route` and `params` are relative nearest parent route.

## Checking if a route is active

The `match` function can be used to manually check if a route is currently active:

```jsx
const { match, routes } = useRoutes();

if (match(routes.HOME)) {
  console.log("The home route is active!");
} else {
  console.log("The home route is NOT active!");
}
```
