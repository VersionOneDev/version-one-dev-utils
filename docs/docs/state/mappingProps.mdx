# Mapping Props

An optional `mapProps` function can be added when creating a store to allow props to be modified/sanitised before an action is called.

It will receive the original props, action name, and key which should be used to map and return a props object to pass on to the action.

```javascript
import { createStore } from "version-one-dev-utils/state";
import PropTypes from "prop-types";

const squareCount = (count) => count * count;

export const CounterStore = createStore({
  name: "CounterStore",
  initialState: {
    count: 0,
  },
  actions: {},
  mapProps: (props, name, key) => {
    if (name === "add") {
      return { count: squareCount(props.count) };
    } else {
      return props;
    }
  },
});
```
