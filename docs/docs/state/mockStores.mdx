# Mocking Stores with Storybook

A MockStore component is available for use with Storybook to help development of components that rely on store state.

The state prop can be used to provide mocked state to the useSelector, useErrors, and usePending hooks.

Actions will be logged in the actions tab along with their props and keys.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { MockStore } from "version-one-dev-utils/storybook";

const Stories = {
  title: "Containers/Counter",
  component: Counter,
};

export default Stories;

export const Default = (args) => {
  const { state, props } = args;
  return (
    <MockStore state={state}>
      <Counter {...props} />
    </MockStore>
  );
};

Default.args = {
  state: {
    CounterStore: {
      count: 1,
    },
  },
  props: {},
};
```
