# Pending Actions

Similar to errors, pending actions are monitored by the PendingStore providing an easy way to display loading states to the end user.

## Accessing Pending Actions with the usePending Hook

The `usePending` hook allows access to and filtering of pending actions in the PendingStore.
When called it will return a `pending` boolean and a `filterPending` function.

```jsx
import { usePending } from "version-one-dev-utils";

const { pending, filterPending } = usePending();
```

## Filtering pending actions

Filtering pending actions is identical to filtering errors with stores, actions, or keys passed to the `usePending` or `filterPending` functions.
Just like the `useError` hook, the `usePending` hook will cause a component to re-render whilst `filterPending` can be used during a render to apply a second level of filtering if needed.

```jsx
import { usePending } from "version-one-dev-utils";
import { CounterStore } from "./CounterStore";

const { pending, filterPending } = usePending(CounterStore);

return (
  <>
    {pending && "An action in the CounterStore is pending"}
    {filterPending(CounterStore.actions.add) &&
      "The add action in the CounterStore is pending"}
  </>
);
```

## Clearing pending actions

Pending state is cleared automatically when an action is successful or throws an error so there is no need to manually clear actions from the `PendingStore`
