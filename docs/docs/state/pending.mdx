# Pending Actions

Similar to errors, pending actions can be accessed with the `usePending` hook providing an easy way to display loading states to the end user.

## Accessing Pending Actions with the usePending Hook

The `usePending` hook allows access to and filtering of pending actions monitored by the `PendingStore`.
It will return a `getPending` function that can be called with optional filters to find pending actions.

```jsx
import { usePending } from "version-one-dev-utils";

const { getPending } = usePending();
const pending = getPending();
```

## Filtering pending actions

Filtering pending actions is identical to filtering errors with stores, actions, or keys passed to the filter function.

```jsx
import { usePending } from "version-one-dev-utils";
import { CounterStore } from "./CounterStore";

const { getPending } = usePending();
const pending = getPending(CounterStore);

return (
  <>
    {pending && "An action in the CounterStore is pending"}
    {getPending(CounterStore.actions.add) &&
      "The add action in the CounterStore is pending"}
  </>
);
```

## Clearing pending actions

Pending state is cleared automatically when an action is successful or throws an error so there is no need to manually clear actions from the `PendingStore`
