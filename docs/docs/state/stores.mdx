# Stores

Stores are used to manage blocks of state in an application. They can be created by calling the `createStore` function and passing a config object containing a `name`, `initialState`, and `actions` object.

```javascript
import { createStore } from "version-one-dev-utils/state";

export const CounterStore = createStore({
  name: "CounterStore",
  initialState: {
    count: 0,
  },
  actions: {},
});
```

Optional `propTypes`, `mapProps`, and `cache` values can be added providing runtime type checking of store state, pre-action mapping of props and caching options.
See [Typechecking With PropTypes](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html), [Mapping Props](mappingProps) and [Caching](caching) for more details.

```javascript
import { createStore } from "version-one-dev-utils/state";
import PropTypes from "prop-types";

export const CounterStore = createStore({
  name: "CounterStore",
  initialState: {
    count: 0,
  },
  actions: {},
  propTypes: PropTypes.objectOf(PropTypes.shape({ count: PropTypes.number })),
  mapProps: (props, name, key) => ({ count: Number(props.count) }),
  cache: { lifespan: 60000 },
});
```

## Accessing State with the useSelector Hook

React components can use the `useSelector` hook to access store state.
The hook fires a callback whenever a store is modified.
An object containing the current state of **all stores** will be passed to the callback with each store's individual state keyed by store name.
This callback should return a value used when rendering the component, if this value _does not_ match the previous value the component will be re-rendered.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { useSelector } from "version-one-dev-utils/state";

export function Counter() {
  const count = useSelector((state) => state.CounterStore.count);

  return <p>The current count is: {{ count }}</p>;
}
```

By default a shallow equality check will be used to compare current and previous values of the selector.
This can be overridden by passing an equality function to the hook as the second argument:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { isEqual } from "lodash";
import { useSelector } from "version-one-dev-utils/state";

export function Counter() {
  const count = useSelector((state) => state.CounterStore.count, isEqual);

  return <p>The current count is: {{ count }}</p>;
}
```

## Accessing State with `getState`

Store state can also be accessed using the `getState` method.
This should be used where state is required outside of a React component, for example when one store relies on the state of another.

```jsx
import { CounterStore } from "./CounterStore";

const CounterStoreState = CounterStore.getState();
```
