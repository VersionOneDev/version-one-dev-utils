# Setup

A test file requires the below boilerplate to run tests on our stories.

You need to install `@storybook/testing-react` which exposes `composeStories`.
This ensures the `MockStore` and `MockRouter` decorators are applied to our tests.

The below example tests that the story `Story1` renders and contains a button element.

```javascript
// React
import React from "react";
// Testing
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import { composeStories } from "@storybook/testing-react";
// Stories
import * as stories from "./index.stories";

const { Story1, Story2 } = composeStories(stories);

describe("Story1", () => {
  it("renders and displays a button", () => {
    render(<Story1 />);
    screen(getByRole("button"));
  });
});
```
