# React App - State Utils

⚠️ This example builds on top of [react-app](../react-app/)

⚠️ To see the differences run `diff -ru --exclude package-lock.json --exclude node_modules examples/react-app examples/react-app-state-utils`

## Requirements

- [Node.js](../../tools/node-js/README.md)

## NPM Link React (Example app only)

To ensure only one instance of react is included in the example app and prevent the "Invalid hook call" error run `npm link ../../node_modules/react`.
This step is for the example app only and can be skipped when using the dev utils with other projects.
